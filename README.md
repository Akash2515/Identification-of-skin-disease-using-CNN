# Identification-of-skin-disease-using-SVM
In this project i specifically classified two types of disease they are Benign and Malignant. I                                               have used one of the machine learning algorithm to classify these disease based on the image. Here i used support vector machine (SVM) for the image classification. With the help of the this model we can be  able to predict what  type of skin disease they are.
